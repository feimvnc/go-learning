about pointer 
operation *cptr = *cptr + 1 
it can be split up into 3 operations: fetch old value by dereferencing pointer, increment value, save value into pointer address.

about channel
use a channel with a buffer of 1 to store the current number, fetch it from the channel when you need it, change it at will, then put it back for others to use.
